# JARVIS - Virtual Assistant

JARVIS is a simple conversational AI built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The assistant interacts with users through text-based conversations, responding to their queries and requests. This project utilizes the OpenAI Python library for API interactions and handles rate limit errors by retrying the request after a short delay.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: JARVIS responds to user inputs and engages in natural language conversations.
- **Rate Limit Handling**: The assistant gracefully handles rate limit errors by retrying after a short delay.
- **Customizable System Messages**: Set your assistant's persona through a system message.
- **Exit Command**: The user can exit the conversation by typing "exit".

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenAI Python library
- A valid OpenAI API key
